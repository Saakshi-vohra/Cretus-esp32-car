# ðŸš— ESP32 Bluetooth Controlled Car  

Welcome to the official guide for the **ESP32 Bluetooth Controlled Car**.  
This project demonstrates wireless communication between a smartphone and an ESP32 microcontroller via Bluetooth, enabling real-time control of a robotic carâ€™s movements. The car is powered by DC motors driven through a motor driver and is designed as a fun, hands-on embedded systems and robotics project.

## Project Overview 

The project consists of the following components:  

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Handles Bluetooth communication and motor control logic.  
- **Motor Driver (L298N / L293D)**: Interfaces ESP32 with DC motors.  
- **Smartphone**: Acts as the controller, sending Bluetooth commands to the ESP32.  

The ESP32 receives directional commands (`F`, `B`, `L`, `R`, `S`) from the phone and drives the motors accordingly.

## Hardware Requirements  

- ESP32 Development Board  
- Motor Driver (L298N)  
- 2 DC Motors with Wheels  
- Car chassis  
- Battery pack (Li-ion) 3S
- Jumper wires and connectors  

---

## Software Requirements

- ESP-IDF / PlatformIO (or Arduino IDE if preferred)    
- **Custom Android APK** (provided in `/App/`) to control the car via Bluetooth

## Mobile App  

To make controlling the car easy, this project includes a **custom Android application** (`ESP32CarController.apk`).  

###  Features  
- Clean UI with on-screen buttons for **Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Stop**  
- Connects directly to the ESP32 over Bluetooth  
- Real-time response with minimal latency  
- Lightweight and easy to install  

###  Installation Steps  
1. Locate the `ESP32CarController.apk` file inside the `/App/` folder of this repository.  
2. Transfer the APK to your Android phone.  
3. Enable *Install from Unknown Sources* (if required in your phoneâ€™s settings).  
4. Tap on the APK file and install it.  
5. Open the app and pair it with your ESP32 device (`ranger`).  

###  Usage  
- Open the app.  
- Pair your phone with the ESP32 via Bluetooth.  
- Use the on-screen control buttons to drive the car.

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide  

1. **Upload Firmware to ESP32**  
   - Open your chosen IDE (ESP-IDF / PlatformIO).  
   - Compile and upload the firmware in `/Code/`.
     
3. **Install the Android App**  
   - Follow the [Mobile App](#mobile-app) section above.
     
2. **Pair Smartphone with ESP32**  
   - On your phone, search for Bluetooth devices.  
   - Pair with `ESP32_BT`.  

3. **Send Control Commands**  
   - Open a Bluetooth terminal app.  
   - Send characters (`F`, `B`, `L`, `R`, `S`) to move the car.  

---

## Control Commands  

- `F` â†’ Forward  
- `B` â†’ Backward  
- `L` â†’ Left  
- `R` â†’ Right  
- `S` â†’ Stop

## Troubleshooting  

- **Car not responding?** Ensure Bluetooth is paired and correct COM port/device is selected.  
- **Motors not moving?** Double-check wiring between ESP32 and motor driver.  
- **Weak movement?** Battery might need charging or replacing.
